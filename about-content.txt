I am currently a Year 3 Business Analytics student in the National University of Singapore. 
I have over the course of my studies developed a keen interest in Data Science - especially in the realms of Machine Learning and AI, 
for which I have gained a deeper appreciation after several exciting projects and hackathons (detailed below). 

I'm love exploring new technologies, new industries, and new experiences. Outside of my academic and career life, 
I am a huge believer in the art of enjoying life's simple pleaures, which to me take the form of reading novels and literature, 
as well as bouldering (which I've recently picked up!)
